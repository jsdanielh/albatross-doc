# Nimiq 2.0

<br />

Nimiq is an easy-to-use and censorship-resistant web payment protocol. It is an open-source project that focuses on accessibility and usability. Nimiq 2.0 shifts from a proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, intending to reduce the energy waste that comes with PoS blockchains and now encouraging users to use their stake as a deposit and thus validate blocks.

Albatross, the Nimiq 2.0 consensus algorithm, presents a novel vision on blockchains inspired by speculative BFT algorithms, focusing on a performance close to the theoretical maximum for a single chain, and a solid probabilistic finality.

<br />

### Blockchain

[Rewards](): distribution among validators.

[Supply formula](): dictates the supply at any given moment.

[Verifiable random function](): random seed used to select validators.

<br />
