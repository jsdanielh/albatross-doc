# Staking Contract

---

A particular contract developed by Nimiq that stores data about validators and stakers in a single location. The staking contract handles all staking related functions. In addition, it tracks validators and stakers, and if they misbehave, they are added to punishment sets.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

Any user with a balance on the Nimiq network can apply to become a validator or staker. Stakers can delegate their coins to validators to use as deposits. Validators validate blocks and are rewarded for their work.
